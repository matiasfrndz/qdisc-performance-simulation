Queueing Discipline Performance Simulation

This is a simple script for performing a monte carlo simulation of different queueing
disciplines (qdisc), such as
- *C*ost of *D*elay *D*ivided by *D*uration (CD3), a specific implementation of *W*eighted *S*hortest *J*ob *F*irst (WSJF)
- Shortest Job First
- Random Prioritisation

both with and without right-sizing.

This simulation was inspired by an [article](https://medium.com/@danvacanti/note-this-is-a-very-early-unedited-version-of-this-article-c3995870a975)
written by [Dan Vacanti](https://twitter.com/danvacanti) and from the work of [Daniel Schimera](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-schimera-45b53916b).
